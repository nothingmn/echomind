 can record. And we don't have a ton of items to get to. And I might be able to do one that might be fun if we have a little bit of time. So corporate events, they, I think I saw a little, I put this in Slack and I saw a little bit of kind of noise around it, which was good. The nutshell here is as we've kind of restructured and tried different things. The event support that we need isn't as nailed down as it needs to be. So the current tactic that we're going with is go-to-market team, signs up and kind of sponsors that event. So you support as a PMM, your campaign manager does the campaigns for that event, etc, etc. I don't see anyone in the, maybe there are comments in the issue. I don't see the header updated yet. I thought we had in Slack sort of farm to each one of them out. So I guess the next, so it looks like tie put in some folks. It looks like this looks good so that let's see needs support from GTM teams. So I guess the ask would be to work with your GTM teams. So let me ask, I saw some Slack, I think in our Slack, but did you all, were you all able to connect with your GTM teams? On Slack only and on the issue actually. Yeah, so I'm not in real time for that. So to be back, I got one person to respond so far. So it may end up Cindy being you and I just picked the one that we want to do and then they can back us up. If we don't get any more feedback. Yeah, do you all, does anybody have like a regular sink still? Are those all been canceled or is there a separate set? Yeah, we're on like the two week cadence. Okay. Yeah, Gidops has been canceled after the enablement. Cool, so I'm just trying to catch up with the thread. So it looks like maybe a platform on reinvent, CICD on Google Next and Gidops on CUBECON, does that sound right? Yeah. Yeah, that's where we were last I heard. Cool, so then I think we can help the Corp events team. They do a lot of like a cat hurting and keep on tracking people down. So I think if this team can take the mission to try to help track that down. So if you get the commitment specifically from your campaign managers, hey, we're signing up for CUBECON. Can you comment on the issue that yes, I can commit to this, etc, etc, etc. So that just so that they can get that event support. But that looks good and I appreciate thanks for the link to SOMI on the rolls. Product announcements. So I appreciate bride for adding this. I probably should have added it, but I had two questions about that one. One is over what time frame are we looking at? So in theory, this could be the same as the GILEP 14 lunch where we're saying basically since 13.0, what kind of big improvements have we made? Can't believe this is always a little bit tough and I'm not totally sure of all of the kind of the interplay here. But I think this is kind of the general gist of this assignment is okay, we have commit coming up. We have some amount of like we have a stage of you know a metaphorical stage to say something to the world and we'll get some amount of press attention because we're having an event, right? What kind of announcements do we make? At GILEP, it's really, really tough to make product announcements because our entire road map is completely public. Yadda, yadda, yadda. So the thought here is to, but also because our entire road map is completely public and because we shift these tiny little MVCs, a new feature will come out but it'll be not really usable, right? So it takes a while. So if you look back over the past year and say okay, like what started in the last year but now is really like a full-fledged feature, what would be coming out of beta, right? Like if we were any other company, when we started a beta program in this last year, what would be announcing is GA at commit? That's kind of my thought on it. I see a couple of head now. What do you think Sydney? Yeah, I think I was inclined to group some things to say like vulnerability management because there were tiny little MVCs all the way along but if you look at over the course of the year, we went from this to this, it makes more sense to me to highlight that than any individual little thing and then the other point was we just had 14.0. Can we just reuse some of those things and plug them in here? Absolutely, yeah. Yeah, and vulnerability management was one of the features out of, we looked at 14.0. So I think, yeah, this is like let's take the stuff from 14.0 and then maybe add a few more so that we can hit kind of different areas of press or give RPR team. This is kind of like input into RPR team to give them fodder to go out with. And are we trying to hit three per stage? Yeah, ideally there's just three, you know, three at a time per stage and then I think y'all made some good notes that okay, we need to add manage. So I see manage in here that's excellent and integrations. We don't well actually we have some pretty exciting integrations. So we have the. The Jira stuff is pretty good. There's a couple of things in integrations with VS code that could be notable but I can I show what I did for SCM just to get some general feedback on it and if someone hasn't done it, maybe that'll also kick right. I was going in simplest direction here, which was thinking you know a lot of and then I called them key iterations, the sort of specific things. So I listed a few specific things like three or four per each as key iterations but I called them something overall. So we have like one thing to call them. There's several key iterations aligned with Giddyly cluster, several that roll up to a research based user experience and I was thinking like I was shy on calling out UX as a bucket except that actually that's that's super typical. Like Windows 11 or anybody who's rolling stuff out, they almost always have UX as one of their three things and then they mentioned a longer list of stuff that aligns to that. So I you know forgave myself for doing something at first that was kind of like shy about calling out UX and bucketing some things there but actually when I looked around that's pretty much how everybody does a big launch. And in terms of the excitement level that also like I went in thinking this is just a two. I guess part of it is like I feel like we're almost fixing something that's broken and that's not something you want to shout from the rooftops about but actually some of that stuff is really cool. So I gave it a three excitement level I wasn't sure exactly where to place things but I figured I wouldn't like the Cindy's comment have something that's a one here anyway but I the only way I could make sense of like the iterations was to bucket them as something and so that's kind of how I came down on it. I don't know what I don't think about that. I've done a similar I've taken a similar approach for monitor with incident management there were a bunch of things that we released although the core of incident management was part of 12.x I think so I did the same with the Redis Web. I think that makes sense. Yeah and that would help me with the plan stuff as well because there are some things like epic boards that people have been asking for for years now and they finally have and that's great but I think you know like the milestone burn up charts that that was a two and that's that's helpful and I was looking through features and you know actual monthly features that were released in a given month I mean that was one of the more important ones but it's not very exciting but we can bundle that with some other things and and and up level it so that that would be helpful there and also Brian about the VS code thing one other cool thing about that is both of those VS code integrations that hit the same month or community contributions which is also kind of cool. Is that is do we have VS code listed on here? I didn't add it but I can add that in like I could note some of that the extension that had been around for a while became official was kind of one of the things but there's some other stuff that's a little juicier than that. And that I think that's a that's a pretty good note as well we did that with like our our Terraform module right there was like a community module but now it's officially supported so that's that's the you know that can be the line yes or no whether you can use the thing for a lot of businesses so I think that's good one too. How are we measuring excitement levels one two and three is there I was I was looking at maybe MAU as a metric to perhaps measure whether customers have started using that are interested in using that or not. We probably may not have it for everything but at least some of it wherever we have it is it's probably something we can we can use there but we of course we need a benchmark level of what MAU we want to call one two three. I think it's a little it's a little bit of a judgment call like um you know for example Kormack was saying like epic boards is something that was asked for for a long time now depending on how it's asked for maybe that means it's exciting or it's not right but usually when something it's a lot of upvotes or when there's a lot of demand for it then I would I would bump the excitement level on something like that. Certainly it's something shipped in a lot of people are using it the MAU that's like that's another good measure I don't know that any one of those needs to kind of be exclusive I think it's a bit of a it's a bit of an individual judgment column just like what is what is your feeling based on you know could be anecdotal like you talk to customers and they're like really hyper excited about this or you know maybe not which is which is okay I think it's okay um I first responded to my comment about why we have the low excitement ones and just said something about having them sort of stack ranked. Yeah I might I might even constrain this is we're not going to highlight low excitement but we want to see the full spectrum especially in the case we have slim pickings alternatively if there are double digit entries then we can stack rank um so that's that's kind of also helpful there so if we have three for all of these that I mean it looks like we're going to get there and that's going to be quite a lot of features so um I might constrain it like this maybe you can only give out one one two or three and and and treat as a stack rank rather than just like a raw excitement level that doesn't necessarily hard to somebody's one or somebody's three may be more important than somebody else's one agree on the yeah and I had um I started by just looking at what was considered a key feature over the past year from from create and you know there are at least a dozen things that I'm not mentioning that could be on the list like I could give you 10 things instead of three yeah give it give this just like the rough like pass and um like a lot of things recently I've been moving between docs and spreadsheet and the spreadsheet to docs this you know this might this might end up or submiteration of this might end up in a spreadsheet where we then try to stack rank in PR like okay out of all of like the you know there's maybe 10 boxes here and three each out of the 30 items which are the top five um actually let's just let's actually just do that let's just do this like top top five overall we did this one is a PR driven to some degree what about like the new pen christie's product keynote at commit are we that I'm telling this with that so this is exactly where this is headed to um is the idea that um during the product keynote and then ideally during kit sits keynote as well that there's some level of like an announcement that we make that then the press cares about that announcement um again really tough to do at get led because it's all been around for a while so this is this is our attempt ahead to that area is to say like these are the announcements of the event and yeah maybe it's some things that have been around for a while but like now they're at a level maturity now you know there's there's a reason to be excited about this so that's kind of where it's coming from so I put a top five overall maybe we can just uh uh you know we should reserve a spot for plan but I'm gonna have to go through and do some aggregating after this just go through the list of what shipped in the last 12 months and we'll re-buck at that so uh uh maybe we can do like five minutes kind of like um just just time box and uh kind of look at these here what do you what do you all think is a top would be a top five out of the list of you know 20 or 30 I would say if ux does end up being a flag that we fly that's an easy one because there's more than just maps to the create stage that would be considered ux improvement okay what else we need to have a security one in there we could have either vulnerability management or um I was when I've been struggling with a little bit as I'd like to kind of group the um some of this the proprietary scanning um without making it sound like they're scanning improvements because that sounds like they weren't good before yeah I let's let's go with vulnerability management for now I now would agree on that one and I would say that um some of these we did do some press around and the the fuzzing acquisitions was one thing so we might not get a comment about that oh mold I I was I mean we did the fuzzing acquisitions a long time ago was it within the past year or longer I thought it was within the past year I think it was in the last the little overs expires or so it was last summer right we're something around there it was like last spring or summer and then we did another set of press around the integration of it because the PR team liked all the it's I mean we got a lot of attention on the acquisitions so they had me do a follow-up um on the integration I just feel like it's kind of worn out now but right that's what I was saying is that the fuzzing we already did press on through probably we'll not get another chump at that so I think let's go with vulnerability management unreviewed but we also have in terms of proprietary stuff we've also got we replaced one of our scanners with sem grip and we did um we have our own proprietary dust scanner now that's in it's in beta called brow zirker so it's our answer to scanning single-page applications which represent a unique challenge I think I mean if I could have to it would be vulnerability management in brosurker probably okay some grip that get picked up as online item in a couple of pieces about get back 14 which uh between between the the proprietary ships of the vulnerability management which would you pick as number one out of those two probably vulnerability management okay I'm just kind of scamming the list I would probably say like Kubernetes agent is something that we've made a lot of investment in although um I think the Kubernetes agent and from an integration point of view perhaps the terra form integration I think we have a lot of customers actually using that already so I'm gonna I'm just gonna call those get-ops and I'm gonna put like this agent plus sg for integrations it's like a bucket of capabilities that is probably worth talking about uh well let's you know let's try to uh this is due Tuesday I think we want to try to get this done um so maybe just uh review this kind of like let's just kind of pick top five maybe something from plan and something from cicd uh that plan editor's definitely an option for cicd yeah there might be a sorry no sorry there might be a value-stream analytics story in there too um if we aggregate it all it's a bummer that customizable value-stream analytics is 12.9 um but uh yeah that might be cool now I'm just gonna I'm gonna ping you on this core-mact to add add a a top five plan cool uh I think I think that's a pretty heavy pretty heavy list just looking at it you know it's pretty cool yeah that's good yeah and this is something we don't do which I I agree like we don't we don't often stop as a company and just kind of look at our wins uh uh I was really I don't did y'all did anybody miss uh what do we call it assembly the assembly um if you missed it I recommend it I laugh because like what assembly reminds me of it like when I was in like a young child in grade school yep you they'd have this big stack of like carpet they're like squares of carpet and you go like you go into the gym and you pull off this a square of carpet and all the children would sit on a square of carpet and that was like you'd have an assembly yeah so that's what I do about that to put everyone in the gym or like convert the half cafeteria gym you know take away the big barrier between it so that we can have more room and then take those carpets that have never been cleaned and just you know sit on them and it'll be it'll be great but aside aside from the goofy name I thought that um and of course we can't talk about any of it on youtube but man that was like a really awesome look back at like here's some wins and here's some exciting things that we've done um and so I think we just need to get better at this as a company I think this exercise and opportunity that um I think we do a little bit of that but this is doing it more so uh saw me you have some questions here for Alita yes so in the competitive sheet I was I mean I've already identified the features for CD config or as well as monitor getting it reviewed from PM my guess was or my understanding was that we wouldn't have the same set of competitors that we're going to compare to but the right competitors for that particular stage right so for example for uh for monitor uh we may not have like a GitHub or something like that we would have monitor based competitors or was in that the understanding because we identified that entire list of competitors and partners for every single stage I thought people were going to be using those competitors to compare against so I just wanted your your input on what because I saw some of you have compared with the five competitors already listed over there um they may not be relevant for example cloud beads may not be relevant for monitor stage at all um so that's what I wanted to check through yeah that's the case I need to go back and look at this spreadsheet I mean if the competitor does not apply to that particular stage they shouldn't be on that tab and spreadsheet so are you saying that you see competitors on that tab for a stage where they don't apply yeah yeah so each sheet has uh has uh adio at lasian github Jenkins jfrog and cloud beads right so that may not be relevant for monitor to configure it would be a different set of competitors that we need to include which I think we already identified a while back I think we identified top three competitors for every stage yeah that's when we tiered them right tier one tier two two three so this this where we are right now is we're looking at just tier one competitors that's probably our current place then because those are all tier ones so we're just focusing on tier one right now so if they don't apply to that stage don't worry about it make sense so just pick the ones out of that list that apply to our stage right i just we just use the tier one competitors and if they're not if they don't are not applicable then we don't have to fill out anything for that yet for now but then we'll move to tier two and tier three then we'll look at those other ones okay and do we need to add a line item for github as well because I think that's the single we're here yeah we should uh I think you asked me that before right or someone asked me i'm just looking at it crying out yeah we good yeah because the way without it you're basically putting all the things that were better at yeah for sure for sure yeah right so ideally when we picked like the 10 to 15 features though some of those were like github only some of those were like github didn't have well i thought it was supposed to be not none of them should be github only right it should be all through the lens of yeah yeah exactly yeah it should be like market lens so an ideal world most of them are like this is what i'm shopping for this solution some like some of them might be github only some of them might be like competitor only so that it's a somebody would look at it and be like this looks honest and trustworthy in like a accurate assessment of the market fair yeah yeah yeah yeah and then yeah i think some of you for this just to kind of reiterate for this one we're only doing these five competitors so we'll do the other ones in a later stage and then uh for if if the vendor builds like builds themselves as a platform then we should specifically call out that they have zero so github builds itself as a platform it sells itself that way same with azure dev ops same with jfrog well they all do for tier one except jinkins and clouties yeah yeah jinkins clouties does not you know right but uh what is it you know azure dev ops github uh at lassian and although at lassians we still need to figure something out there that is a matter of fact that i go back and add a lassian based on conversation i think we have to do it i don't think we can leave them all you know i don't like to look at this version it is lassian is on that sheet okay yeah i went back and added them because based on a discussion like my my i wanted to take them off completely and just leave them as a partner but we can't do that so so yeah so for for those platform you know we should call out the fact that they don't have any monitoring if they have like zero out of 15 we should call that out um same with configure stuff for this you know any those kind of capabilities and be and be i think if we took that step further it'd be good to even describe it in the way that doesn't just say our product stage and use like a value-based description of what monitor can figure mean because otherwise we're just no that's not going to do any good for us i think i've seen the new infographic that the design team has come up with not yet oh you haven't no we have a link to that quickly William i don't know or you throw it in the uh you throw it in the um notes if you find it i let's see who can find it faster and guarantee you're not with the amount of tabs i have open oh my god that's what i'm like it probably won't be me so i this is why i send everything to a google uh gmail because the search is so fast so i literally have a folder where all of my get-led things go and i can just search for infographic and i found it i found it i found it who could look at first i found it i found it oh so this is the one so this there's two this is the one for the single two comparison but then for the um but it's it's gonna look the same but then here's the one for i just put it in chat for you guys and here's the one for the platform player so we made it we made a couple decisions along the way so um one of the decisions was to just go with stages um it would it would have been like a whole another layer of okay if we don't go with just the get-lapse stages the 10 stages what do we use that has to be determined reconciled all this kind of stuff like the you know we kind of i don't know how long it's been since we updated those pages have like not been updated but we kind of are just trying to move towards some sort towards some progress so i concur that maybe configuring monitors not as descriptive as it could be but the place where it will so actually i'll share one thing it just seems like the right time to do this right manages is even less descriptive than that so so um the way this is the way this is getting built is off of a data model so um in theory these could change or be updated where the underlying data remains the same right because like we're separating like like presentation layer from data layer uh so that's it's not gonna be as hard to update in the future as it currently is where it's a messes spaghetti code and it's like really really difficult to update and then the other component is then not in this iteration we need to get something live but in the next iteration you'll click on verify and it'll go down to the list of the 15 features and that's where you can describe what the heck of verify is or what the heck i managed okay so we will have an opportunity that because i was about to say you're gonna hate me for this but like we're we're being cyclical about the same problem we had which being the audience coming in and not knowing anything about these specific stages yeah that was one of the big things it's like okay 15 15 features what what is what are they why do i care you know yeah to say that means nothing to me looking at this this page um but quick question i can beat every downer that's it no we're on top of it i actually if you read the thread i brought that up but she said we can't do it like right now which i understand but small thing what do you guys think about the colors uh no no i usually let the designers handle that stuff they they i like yeah i like the fact that there's no red on there oh you like that that's what i was going for you like that it's not it's not obviously negative uh so we're saying because it really does lend itself to being a comparison more than a competitive piece because of that because there's no you know these folks at 37% are in the red and they're terrible they just have less green or we would have less green so it's not it's not it's not being worse it's being less good and i think that lends itself to working with you know you're all the co-opetition situations we were talking about yeah that's that's a goal is we want we want to generate a helpful asset for the industry this is not just like marketing shill this should be like a helpful page uh so it's like yeah the goals have a comparison comparing DevOps tools not a you know this is all of our competitors and why we're better yeah um i i i think from a competitive mindset and for me i'm like let's go hard let's put some red on there let's just the way i think right so but i'm going to wait it up and that for now we're going to stick with the green they recommend it was stick with the green and uh see how it goes but i don't know i was feeling the red and yellow too it is easy on the eyes you know there's something to be said for that so yeah uh cool well we're almost up on time but i did want to share one thing that kind of came in like basically friday it was like late thursday for me so this uh this is another thing a lot a lot of these things that don't have like a ton of context on um i just know like we're just trying to up our game so like hey let's move fast and do the best we can do um so this is a little bit of a messaging framework and then the assignment that was given to me was to to fill in these boxes here so uh and then this was the father that i got so there was these ones that said like from road map to company vision we are transparent and a single source of truth countless possibilities honestly i think this ones are like really pithy and catchy uh i really like it i really liked uh what's the other one that i like that not everyone does um all in one for everyone so i just uh i don't know i like i just think so there's something catchy about that um but i know that kind of catchy is not everyone's cup of tea all that's to say is um the assignment here was that i took it was to write a pithy few words like punchy statement for each of these three things uh so i ended up with a single source of truth countless possibilities i like that a lot um this one i went with end-to-end control over your software factory not as pithy but or like not as catchy but um i think i like it what so what's the difference between that slide and the next one that doesn't have anything under security this this was the um honestly so that so when i first got this it didn't have this and it didn't have anything under security so this this was like it was just your iteration of it yeah this is this is mine this is i just put here so that i would have like the original statements like you know automate nearly anything collaborate on everything i kind of like that but i you know this one i hate scale-up speed-up test-up i don't think anybody tests up i think that's really goofy so hate it uh this one i love that for me it's i i love it or hate it right um i love how i love that you're just like bam uh so anyway the what i love in just in five minutes now and then we can kind of and the call is kind of like um anything that you would change this out for anything that you would change this out for and then actually let's start here this one i couldn't pick and i'll i'll tell you why it's because i i like things to have parity in in their tone right so this is maybe like super nuanced elements of messaging but i hate it if it's like a single source of truth that's like in noun phrase and the end control that's like a noun item so you could say with gittlab you get a single source of truth with gittlab you get and the end control and you can't say with gittlab you get move fast with confidence no but you can say more speedless risk i like that one the best i don't like the last one i agree that's that's why i put this one at top was for that parity and then so it sounds like kind of y'all's thoughts are that's that's good as well yeah the only thing it might be missing but i don't know how we do it without over complicating it is well i guess less risk also implies higher quality i guess that kind of bundles the quality and the security together so i've talked myself out of not liking that so yeah good it's in these last blog posts that are really good turn of phrase that i stole for forgive ad 14 when she was out it was like secure the software factory and all the stuff that you're making it since she said it really elegant and it's deliverables secure the software factory and it's deliverables yeah i thought it was good to emphasize both because they mean they're months yeah yeah so you could say secure and control your software factory and it's deliverables maybe that would encompass both thoughts i'm not a big fan of the it's it's deliverables is there a can we say like your software factory and your software or your your software or your product product sounds like car manufacturer it's like ip here but it just doesn't sound right and that's always to always short hand yeah i like this one better yeah i think i do too but but i appreciate the thought Ryan and then the last thing i'll say is so this is this was my attempt to to channel my inner ash withers um i think ash is like super good at just again just like the catchier like the turn of phrase element to it um and so like this kind of idea like single source of truth countless possibilities or all in one for everyone there's something catchy about this so so here i was trying to like envision what is it that we actually give you with this velocity it's like it's velocity with confidence is what is what you get um i like your move fast with confidence better than increased speed and stay on track yeah so i was trying to i was thinking of like you know if you're like if you're in a race car and like you go like super super fast like let's say you're in the bike race right and you're going so fast and somebody holds out the sign and then like half of the bike race collapses it's easier right um so it's almost kind of like you can you can keep going like faster faster faster and if somebody like jumps out with a sign in the middle of the racetrack you're not going to get tripped up by it because get labs you know it's testing is going to catch that it's security is going to catch that um all of those elements that allow you to move faster but to do so with confidence because otherwise you're like the faster you go then it gets more dangerous so try to encapsulate that in this like that was kind of where i was like stay on track but i i didn't like it either did you just open the door or NASCAR partnership hey NASCAR goes fast in terms left because it get lab so you're a new ricky body and demographic so yeah so i don't think i like that one and then i think between these two i like move fast with confidence but i don't like the the verbage of it because it doesn't have parity so that's where i think more people do you want to add maybe we can add high confidence or more confidence at the end of your first statement so it kind of combines all of it so more speed less risk high confidence i'm just saying confidence is kind of overused anyway like i see a lot of competitors of vendors using it i really like the first one just more speed less risk bam no trade-offs you know just this how it is um oh no trade-offs i don't know yeah that's one of my go-toes i love that one uh this this gets into the uh no trade-offs the engineer engineer in me says there's never no trade-offs that's like saying like 100% secure conflict this is why we always say mitigate right we always risk or less risk you never say no we never say no we never say no we're not we're not necessarily messaging right i mean not everything you know i'm not just more speed less risk with confidence what yeah more speed the ricky bobby and me really did like the no trade-offs without Parker yeah oh is that was that from uh no but it could have been it's something ricky bobby would have said if anyone hasn't seen tally day goodnight so they should and so homework for this weekend tally day has come back and we talk about it on monday and our little social pork i often say thank you little eight pound five ounce baby Jesus with the golden diapers i say that so often that i just think everybody has seen tally day goodnight but then i realized that people that haven't are like playing is really weird or the next week we'll watch stepbrothers that's another great one so much room for activities okay um i'm gonna go with uh more speed less risk and um i think this is due at the end of the day so any additional thoughts i'm actually gonna untag expect me strong all those are you know cool those are good awesome well uh this was kind of fun to do a little bit of like working together session and uh keep it a little razzle dazzle keep it rocking good to see everybody see you soon

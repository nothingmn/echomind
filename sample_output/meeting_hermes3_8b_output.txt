It sounds like you had an engaging and creative brainstorming session with your team to come up with catchy slogans or taglines that encapsulate the key benefits and philosophy behind your software development velocity tool. 

From what I gather, a few of the top contenders are:
1. "Move Fast With Confidence" - Emphasizes speed without sacrificing quality or security.
2. "More Speed, Less Risk" - Highlights faster development while minimizing risks like defects or vulnerabilities.
3. "No Trade-Offs" - Asserts that you can achieve high velocity without having to compromise elsewhere.

I like how these all aim to distill the core value prop in a pithy, memorable way. The confidence angle adds an encouraging tone and differentiates from the usual hard sell.

In terms of specific phrasing, I lean towards "More Speed, Less Risk". It's simple, punchy and relatable. People can intuitively grasp what it means for their dev process. And risk mitigation is a key concern they'll appreciate you addressing head-on.

I'm not as fond of the "Move Fast With Confidence" one because "confidence" feels a bit overused in this context. When I hear that, my kneejerk reaction is "of course they want me to be confident, it's their product after all". I prefer a message that seems more genuine and less self-serving.

"No Trade-Offs" has merit but as you noted, using "no" or implying 100% certainty can set unrealistic expectations. More of an art than science, I see your point about the subtlety being important here.

Ultimately, these are all strong options from what looks like a thorough brainstorm. The best choice will depend on how it lands with different audiences and channels. But in summary, "More Speed, Less Risk" would be my vote - it succinctly conveys tangible benefits while subtly hinting at the confidence boost behind them. Feel free to take this as just one data point though, as I'm sure you've got plenty of good ideas to choose from in your war room! Let me know if you need any other thoughts as you finalize this.
